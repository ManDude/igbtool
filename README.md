**igbtool** is a project for utilities to handle .IGB (Intrinsic Graphics binary) files used for *Crash Nitro Kart* (PS2, XBOX, GCN). It may work on other games' files, but this is not tested.

There are actually two programs in this repo:

## igbtool

The titular **igbtool**, which is a command-line utility to extract IGB file information and save it to a text file. It also supports ripping images from IGB files, but this does not actually work.

## igbgui

A GUI for inspecting IGB files. This is built using .NET Core 5.0 WinForms, so it is Windows-only. A Linux version would be nice, though.
